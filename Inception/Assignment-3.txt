2 Superpowers of JSX
Babel is a package that is a compiler/transpiler of JavaScript
that is already present inside ‘node-modules’. It takes JSX and
converts it into the code that browsers understand, as soon as
we write it and save the file. It is not created by Facebook.

JSX (transpiled by Babel) ⇒ React.createElement ⇒ ReactElement
⇒ JS Object ⇒ HTML Element(render)
